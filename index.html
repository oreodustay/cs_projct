    <h2>Milestone 1 - Holding The Title As The "First Programmer"</h2>
    <p>Ada Lovelace translated an article by Luigi Menabrea in 1843 about an Analytical Engine.<br>
      While doing so, Lovelace wrote expanded notes and labeled them from A to G. These notes<br> 
      were several times longer than the actual translation. Within note G, it detailed precise,<br>
      step-by-step sequences of operations for the Analytical Engine to calculate a sequence of<br>
      Bernoulli numbers. (Bernoulli numbers are often used to represent variables in formulas and<br>
      mathematics.)<br>
      This achievement was recognised globally, and Lovelace was given the title of the first<br>
      programmer to publish computer algorithms for machines.<br><br>

      <strong>Analytical Engine definition:</strong> A 19th-century mechanical computer designed by Charles Babbage.<br> 
      It became the first programmable machine, which featured memory and a processor.<br> 
      This was the starting point and basic layout for our modern computers — a prototype.<br>
