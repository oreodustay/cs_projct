    <p id = "milestone1">Ada Lovelace translated an article by Luigi Menabrea in 1843 about an Analytical Engine.<br>
      While doing so, Lovelace wrote expanded notes and labeled them from A to G. These notes <br>
      were several times longer than the actual translation. Within note G, it detailed precise, <br>
      step-by-step sequences of operations for the Analytical Engine to calculate a sequence of <br>
      Bernoulli numbers. (Bernoulli numbers are often used to represent variables in formulas <br>
      and mathematics.)
      This achievement was recognised globally, and Lovelace was given the title of the first<br>
      programmer to publish computer algorithms for machines.<br><br>

    <strong>Analytical Engine definition:</strong> A 19th-century mechanical computer designed by Charles Babbage.<br>
    It became the first programmable machine, which featured memory and a processor. This was the<br>
    starting point and basic layout for our modern computers — a prototype.
